Extract the names of the desired codebase-specific types to search for. Ignore standard library types or wrappers. Prefer fully qualified names over shorthand names.

Return a JSON result, with a list of "identifiers" as shown:

```json
{
	identifiers: [
		"Some.Example.Identifier",
		"Some.Other.Identifier"
	]
}
```

## EXAMPLE
The relationships extracted from the provided C# code have some missing type information. Specifically, the type of the `site` variable returned by `GraphServiceClient.FetchSiteByIdAsync` is not fully qualified, and the type of the `publishedSite` variable returned by `OneNoteAssimilator.CreatePublishedSiteAsync` is also not fully qualified.

Search these types:
1. `GraphServiceClient.FetchSiteByIdAsync` return type (likely `Site` or a more specific type).
2. `OneNoteAssimilator.CreatePublishedSiteAsync` return type (likely `AppClient.Model.PublishedOneNoteSite` or a more specific type).

These additional class or interface docs will help complete the type information in our extracted triples.

```json
{
	"identifiers": [
		"GraphServiceClient.FetchSiteByIdAsync",
		"OneNoteAssimilator.CreatePublishedSiteAsync"
	]
}
```
